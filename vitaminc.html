        <p>Vitamin C, also known as ascorbic acid, is a water-soluble vitamin that is essential for the growth, development, and repair of body tissues. It plays a crucial role in various bodily functions and is renowned for its antioxidant properties.

            Key functions of vitamin C include:
            
            Antioxidant activity: Vitamin C is a powerful antioxidant that helps protect cells from damage caused by free radicals. Free radicals are unstable molecules produced in the body due to various factors like pollution, cigarette smoke, and even as byproducts of normal bodily processes. Antioxidants like vitamin C neutralize these free radicals, thereby reducing oxidative stress and the risk of certain chronic diseases.
            
            Collagen synthesis: Vitamin C is essential for the production of collagen, a protein that helps maintain the health of skin, cartilage, bones, and blood vessels. Collagen is crucial for wound healing, as it contributes to the structure and strength of various tissues in the body.
            
            Immune function: It supports the immune system by enhancing the function of immune cells and helping the body fight off infections. Adequate intake of vitamin C is associated with a reduced duration and severity of common colds in some individuals.
            
            Absorption of iron: Vitamin C enhances the absorption of non-heme iron (the type of iron found in plant-based foods) from the diet. Consuming foods rich in vitamin C alongside iron-rich plant foods can help increase the absorption of iron by the body.
            
            Sources of vitamin C include fruits (such as oranges, strawberries, kiwi, guava), vegetables (like bell peppers, broccoli, tomatoes), and some fortified foods. While it's important to get enough vitamin C for overall health, it's a water-soluble vitamin, meaning the body doesn't store it, so it needs to be consumed regularly through diet or supplements.
            
            Deficiency in vitamin C can lead to scurvy, a condition characterized by fatigue, weakness, swollen gums, joint pain, and impaired wound healing. Most people can obtain sufficient vitamin C through a balanced diet that includes a variety of fruits and vegetables. However, for some individuals, such as those with certain health conditions or dietary restrictions, supplements may be recommended under the guidance of a healthcare professional.</p>
