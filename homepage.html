            <p>Vitamins are essential organic compounds that the human body needs in small amounts to function properly. They play crucial roles in various physiological processes, including metabolism, immune function, growth, and development. Vitamins are obtained through the diet, primarily from a well-balanced and diverse intake of foods such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, seeds, dairy products, and meats.

                There are 13 essential vitamins categorized into two groups based on their solubility:
                
                Water-soluble vitamins: These include vitamin C and the B-complex vitamins (such as B1, B2, B3, B5, B6, B7, B9, and B12). They dissolve in water and are not stored in the body for extended periods. Excess amounts are usually excreted in urine.
                
                Fat-soluble vitamins: This group consists of vitamins A, D, E, and K. They dissolve in fat and are stored in the body's fatty tissues and liver. Unlike water-soluble vitamins, excess fat-soluble vitamins can accumulate in the body and may lead to toxicity if consumed excessively.
                
                Each vitamin has specific functions and benefits. For instance, vitamin C supports the immune system and helps in collagen production, while vitamin D aids in calcium absorption and bone health. A balanced diet that includes a variety of nutrient-rich foods is essential to ensure an adequate intake of vitamins and maintain overall health. In some cases, dietary supplements may be recommended to address deficiencies or specific health needs under the guidance of a healthcare professional.</p>
